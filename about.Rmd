I am a first-generation college graduate and first-year PhD student in the Environmental Health Sciences department at Columbia University. After finishing my BS in Cell and Developmental Biology and a fifth year studying public health through the Take 5 Scholars program, I am looking forward to merging my two passions throughout this PhD program. I plan to study Environmental Epigenetics and Molecular Mechanisms with the hope to gain better understandings of how physical and non-physical environmental stressors impact the epigenome and ultimately health and well-being.
