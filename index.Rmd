# This is Alana's awesome website

One important feature of your site will be hyperlinks. The general format for links is [text for link](address.of.link). So, to link to my favorite tool for data science, I’d use [this](google.com).

Your website usually has more than one page. These pages can be created using the same process as index.html: create an Rmd file and knit to html. Once you have another page (e.g. about.html) you need to link to it from your home page (e.g. using use [about](about.html)), or no one will be able to find it.

Sometimes you want to add images – pictures you’ve taken or found on the internets, rather than things that are generated from analyses. This is a bit more involved than other things you might want to do. RMD’s default image settings (using ![](image.jpg)) aren’t great.
